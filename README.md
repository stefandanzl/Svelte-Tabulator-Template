# Svelte + Tabulator Vite Template
## Based on: Svelte + TS + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

It can be used as a reference how to implement [Tabulator](https://tabulator.info/) in Svelte.

Tabulator is set up in `/src/Table.svelte` and the data in `/src/App.svelte`.

Additionally `luxon.min.js` was added and linked in `index.html` to be able to sort by date.
